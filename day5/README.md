# Day 5

Today you'll continue with the app you built yesterday, adding at least one new feature to it. Below are some suggestions for what you might add. The most important thing is that you add something that interests you, so that you'll learn as much as possible.

In addition to this, you're going to push the code up to a new repo on GitHub.

## Suggested goals

* Create animations using Jquery to effect your pages content (e.g how the images are loaded on the page checkout JQuery's FadeIn and FadeOut methods). 

* Make your page responsive by using Bootstrap. (Ask us for help.)

* Style your page using CSS. 

* Swap out the flickr api with the Instagram api.

* Indent and comment your code.


## The Path Ahead
