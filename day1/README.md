# Monday  

You'll be working in pairs, creating a portfolio page from scratch. At the end of the day, you'll learn how to get the site live using GitHub Pages.

The site will be built through the tree exercises listed below. The Git exercise will be preceeded by a lecture on the subject.  

## Command line basics

We'll start off the day by giving you a quick crash course in the command line interface, teaching you the commands you'll need to know to get through the day.	

## Git exercise

If you haven't installed Git yet, you'll have to do it.  
For Mac users, the easiest thing is to install git with Homebrew. To get Homebrew, just type the following into Terminal:

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

After this, you should be able to install git like this:

	brew install git

If you're using Windows, go to [this link](http://git-scm.com/download/win). If you're using Linux, simply follow these [instructions.](http://git-scm.com/download/linux.)

* Create a new public repository on GitHub (named *username*.github.io)
* Clone the repo into your local machine
* Create an file named *index.html* pasting in the code from the HTML file in this repo
* Add and commit your changes
* Push your changes to your GitHub repo.

## HTML exercise

The *index.html* you created in the previous exercise will be the basis for your portfolio page. Add at least the following content to your page:

* A profile picture
* Your name and contact information
* An unordered list (containing for example interests or works)
* A 'Contact me' form (will be disfunctional at this point)

## CSS exercise

Now its about time to style your page. The point with this exercise it not to make your site beatuiful but to get to know the concepts behind CSS. Do the following:

* Find a font you like at Google Fonts and use it on your page
* Give your profile image an ID and style it 
* Add a class to an element/group of elements and style the class
* Style the first element in your list using CSS selectors

### Stretch goals

* Finish up the [Javascript track at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)
* Create a new branch in your Git repo
* Learn how to push to and pull from different branches, plus merging them together
